## Overview

![screenshot](Screenshoterror.png)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
To be indicated soon
- What was your experience?
My experience so far working with CSS on this mini-project has been a good one for me. Well.. I love replicating designs so taking up this challenge was not a biggie. I'm almost done with this challenge. 
Feel free to review my code! I'd love to receive feedback.

NB: to be updated soon ):
- What have you learned/improved?
My understanding of flexbox and its properties.
- Your wisdom? :)
Hmmm, well... for now I have nothing in particular to share.

NB: This space will be updated with time
