## Overview

![screenshot](Screenshoterror.png)


- Click the demo link above for a preview
- My experience so far working with CSS on this mini-project has been a good one for me. Well.. I love replicating designs so taking up this    challenge was not a biggie. I'd be willing to try challenges like these in the near future.
Feel free to review my code! I'd love to receive feedback.
- My understanding of flexbox and its properties has improved
- Your wisdom? :)
Hmmm, well... for now I have nothing in particular to share.
